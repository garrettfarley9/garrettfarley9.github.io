<h2>About Me</h2>h2>
I started my professional career as a science teacher in highly collaborative school settings that relied on communication and teamwork to best serve students. During the pandemic, I pivoted away from science education to computer science after a quick hike up the east coast. I picked up R and started taking prerequisite CS classes and now I hold a graduate level certificate in Data Science from the Univ. Missouri St. Louis. <br>
I am seeking an entry level Machine Learning Engineer position. My study interests exist at the intersection of Environmentalism, GIS and Machine Learning for a greener and cooler world.
