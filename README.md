<h2>About Me</h2>
I started my professional career as a science teacher in highly collaborative school settings that relied on communication and teamwork to best serve students. During the pandemic, I pivoted away from science education to computer science after a quick hike up the east coast. I picked up R and started taking prerequisite CS classes and now I hold a graduate level certificate in Data Science from the Univ. Missouri St. Louis. <br>
I am seeking an entry level Machine Learning Engineer position. My study interests exist at the intersection of Environmentalism, GIS and Machine Learning for a greener and cooler world. 

<h2>Technical Skills and Software</h2>
Machine Learning Algorithms<br>
Data Analysis<br>
Data Visualization<br>
Reinforcement Learning<br>
Deep Learning<br>

Programming Languages: R(shiny, caret, tidyverse), Python(scikit-learn, pandas, tensorflow)<br>
Visualization: Tableau<br>
Database: Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access<br>
GIS: ArcGIS, QGIS<br>
Version Control: Git, Github<br>

<h2>Extras, Interests and Passions</h2>

<h2>Portfolio Projects</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/garrettfarley9/Soeul-Bikes-Linear-Regression/blob/main/Seoul_bikes_Linear_regression.ipynb">Soeul Bike Linear Regression Model</a><br>
This is my final project in my Python for Data Science class. I found a bike rental dataset on Kaggle.com and created a linear regression model after some feature engineering.<br>

<a href ="https://github.com/garrettfarley9/Binary-Classification-ANN/blob/main/Binary_Classification_ANN.ipynb">Mushroom Binary classification with neural network</a><br>
This project was a final project for my AI class in my graduate certificate program. I used a neural network to do binary classification on mushroom edibility -- Edible or Poisonous.

<a href ="https://github.com/garrettfarley9/Rich-Tree-City/blob/master/Final%20Project.pdf">Tree City correlation to median housing price in Missouri GIS map</a><br>
The Arbor Day Foundation offers a city designation for Urban Forestry. I've seen estimates where a house's value can be raised by ~6%. I scraped housing data from Zillow.com and did a statistical analysis of the cities in Missouri that are 'Tree Cities' vs. Not. If you live in a 'Tree City' your house is statistically valued more than those who aren't in a 'Tree City.'

<a href = "https://github.com/garrettfarley9/STL_neighborhood_trees">Easement Tree DBH correlation to median housing price in Saint Louis, MO GIS map</a><br>
I am very interested in the intersection between urban forestry and the impact on housing prices and livibility of cities. Here I scraped forestry data from St. Louis' Open Data repository and housing data from Zillow.com and used QGIS and Python to process the data to generate maps of median housing prices and the number of trees / diameter at breast height (DBH). Interestingly, you can clearly see the redlining that happens in St. Louis.<br>
